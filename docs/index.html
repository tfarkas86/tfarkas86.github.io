                <span style="color:#a2dbc1"><q>All models are wrong.</q></span> -- George Box. <br>
                To ensure models are useful, I draw from and combine a broad set of modern machine learning 
                and traditional statistical approaches. Central to my modeling philosophy is extensive domain research, 
                stakeholder and SME collaboration, and dogged data exploration. 
                Careful treatment and presentation of uncertainty is critical in most contexts, 
                and interpretable models are of paramount importance for stakeholder acceptance.

                <h5>Optimizing Cropland Planning with Genetic Algorithms</h5>
                <p>
                Farmers face a lot of complex decisions in the course of their work. One such problem
                is to determine how much of which crops they should plant to make the most efficient use 
                of their monetary and land resources.
                </p>               
                <p>
                In simple circumstances, monocropping with whatever gives the greatest resturn on 
                investment would be best, or maybe there's a clear approach to mixing crops given 
                a restricted budget. 
                But farmers often face a complex set of constraints that take these planning tasks 
                from obvious to hard. For example, perhaps the farms have a limited budget for planting, 
                always want to bring at least two crops to market, and don't want to plant less than 
                one acre of any one crop. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Now the problem is hard. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness">NP hard</a> 
                to be exact, meaning that not only are the solutions 
                not obvious, the best numerical optimization approaches can't find optimal solutions quickly. 
                In these circumstances, combinatorial optimization approaches -- like 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">genetic algorithms</a> and
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing">simulated annealing</a> -- 
                can offer solutions in a reasonable timeframe. 
                </p>
                <p>
                In this work, I used genetic algorithms, which biomimic the process of evolution by natural 
                selection (a favorite topic of mine!) to find cropland planting configurations that 
                have the highest yield, yet conform 
                to a number of real-world constraints.</p>
                <p>
                I will detail the approach in a longer blog post, 
                but the big trick here was to repurpose binary chromosomes to encode an arbitrary number 
                of crops through one-hot encoding.
                It required creating custom functions to initialize the population, perform chromosomal 
                crossover, as well as mutation to make it work, in addition to the custom fitness function
                that encodes the constraints.

                <h5>Desert Plant Traits and Population Dynamics</h5>
                <p>
                 The effect of climate change on ecosystems is undeniable and increasingly severe. 
                 Understanding which organisms will respond to changing climate in which ways is a major goal for stewards and managers, 
                 but the idiosyncracies of each species make predicting responses a challenge. 
                Because environmental impacts to organisms are mediated by their traits, 
                a focus on trait-based ecology can help refine a predictive framework for understanding change in biological communities. 
                </p>
                <p>
                In this work, I orchestrated the collection of thousands of plants samples from over 100 species in the 
                <a href="https://www.fws.gov/refuge/sevilleta">Sevilleta Wildlife Refuge</a> 
                and measured over a dozen plant traits for each, 
                including plant height, tissue density, elemental and isotope composition, and fine-root structure, 
                to look for commonalities in the way plants with similar traits fluctuate in biomass year over year. 
                </p>
                <p>
                There's just one problem: All the plants I looked at -- indeed, all organisms on Earth -- 
                have a shared evolutionary history. 
                This means that any statistical analysis of traits across species needs to account for non-independence in traits. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Approaches to addressing shared evolutionary history are well worked out, 
                but implementations are non-trivial. 
                A first step is to acquire an evolutionary tree,
                complete with estimates of branch lenghts between nodes, 
                which requires a major data wrangling effort. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Next is to compute phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs),
                which comes with it's own complications.
                One of the largest aspects of this project was creation of 
                <a href="https://github.com/tfarkas86/sevilleta-plant-traits/blob/main/src/features/pic_fxns.R">reproducible tools</a> 
                for creating and evaluating PICs. 
                </p>
                <p>
                And lastly, the modeling effort to evluate the relationship between plant traits and population dynamics. 
                This part is a work in progress, so keep checking back! 
                But work done to date has focused on determining the "right" biomass-based response metrics, 
                and constructing principal components for regression, 
                given extreme multicollinearity among the traits I measured.

                <h5>Noisy Neighbors</h5>
                <p>
                A New England pond can be deafening in the Spring. 
                A primary culprit is green frogs (<i>Rana clamitans</i>), 
                who call incessantly to attract mates. 
                But their not the only one's trying to strut their stuff. 
                The American bullfrog (<i>Rana catesbeiana</i>) breeds concurrently
                and their calls are even louder and longer,
                drowning out the green frogs. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                Given the importance of breeding calls, 
                vocal interference could seriously impact reproductive success. 
                To cope with their noisy neighbors, scientists hypothesize that 
                green frogs time their calls for intra-call pauses of their nearest bullfrog neighbors. 
                </p>
                <p>
                In this work, I used non-parametric analysis to determine whether green frogs 
                were avoiding bullfrog calls from audio recordings in the field.  
                I bootstrapped call duration and start time 
                for green frog and bullfrogs separately to determine the empirical probability distribution 
                of call interference (overlap) under randomness. 
                With this approach, it was clear that the observed (lack of) overlap between 
                green frog and bullfrog calls was very unlikely to occur by chance.
