                           I was recently developing software for a colleague, Rob, at <a href='www.ecodata.tech'>EcoData Technology</a>.   
                           The tool, called 
                           <a href="https://github.com/tfarkas86/ecodatamisc/blob/main/R/export_anova.R">export_anova</a>, 
                           automatically creates publication-ready tables from ANOVA output in R. 
                           </p>
                           <p>
                           As written, the tool worked perfectly, just perfectly, on my Mac, effortlesslly turning this ugly thing:
                           <br><br>
                           <img src="images/blog-pics/002/anova-raw.png" alt="">
                           <br><br>
                           Into this: 
                           <br><br>
                           <img src="images/blog-pics/002/anova-pretty.png" alt="">
                         </p>
                         <p> 
                           But, my client works on Windows.
                           When he tried it ... nothing. 
                           </p>
                           <p>
                           The next several weeks (of very part-time work) saw over twenty emails back and forth, 
                           updates to the code, adjustments to his Windows environment, a few Zoom calls, 
                           and lots, lots, lots of frustration.  
                           </p>
                           <p class="blog-post__excerpt">
                           Short of debugging directly on his PC,
                           I decided I needed to work on a Windows machine. 
                           Any Windows machine.  
                           So I looked up the cheapest PCs I could find at Best Buy (around $150), 
                           and got geared up for a quick errand at 8PM on a Thursday. 
                           </p> 
                           <p>
                           Then I remembered how useful I had found it to spin up Linux machines in the cloud with AWS for past projects. 
                           Those machines were all command-line driven, and wouldn't have been all that useful in this context, 
                           but AWS has dozens of OS offerings. 
                           Lo and behold, Windows Server is one of them, offering access to a clean Windows GUI.  
                           I got to work sorting out the details of creating and accessing a Windows Server machine on AWS, 
                           and had it all working within a couple hours. 
                           A day later, I had Rob sorted out, furiously creating gorgeous tables for his latest pub. 
                           </p>
                           <p>
                           Here's what I, working on a 2015 Macbook Pro, needed to do. 
                           </p>
                           <h3>1. Launch An EC2 With Windows Server</h3>
                           <p class="blog-post__excerpt">
                           Assuming you already have 
                           <a href="https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start/email">an AWS account</a>, 
                           navigate to the Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) service and click "Launch Instance". 
                           Then follow these steps: 
                           <br>
                           <ol>
                                   <li>Choose a Windows Server image. I used Microsoft Windows Server 2019 Base.
                                           Feel free to consider an option with more features, but this one qualifies for free tier.</li>
                                   <li>Choose an instance type. What you go with depends on what you need to do. 
                                           I went with the t2.medium, which is equivalent to one of those $150 machines I might have bought at Best Buy.</li>
                                   <li>Add storage. The default, 30GB, wasn't enough for me. 
                                           I bumped the root volume up to 60GB.</li>                            
                                   <li>Configure security group. 
                           Change the source from "Custom" to "My IP", so that only you have access to this machine. 
                           You can add more IPs if you want other folks to have access.</li> 
                                   <li>Click "Launch", and collect access credentials. 
                           Unless you already have a key pair to use, create a new one. 
                           Download the .pem file and put it somewhere safe. 
                           Then click "Launch Instances".</li> 
                                   <li>Once the instance is running, navigate to it's summary page, and click "Connect" at the top. 
                                           We'll use the "RDP client" (remote desktop) approach.
                                           Download the RDP file, 
                                           then retrieve the password by copy-and-pasting the entire contents of your .pem file into the provided box. 
                                           Record the resulting password somewhere safe. 
                                   </li>
                           </ol>
                           
                           <h3>2. Login To Your Instance with Microsoft Remote Desktop</h3>
                           <p>
                           If you don't have it already, get Microsoft Remote Desktop.
                           It's available at the App Store, 
                           and it permits remote login to active Windows machines. 
                           Once MRD is installed and running, follow tese steps:
                           </p><br>
                           <ol>
                                <li>In MRD, navigate to "Connections", then "Import from RDP file ...", 
                                        and select the RDP file you downloaded in step 1.6. 
                                        You should see a card representing your new machine in the GUI for MRD. 
                                </li>
                                <li>Click the new card to open a login dialog for the AWS machine. 
                                        Enter the password you harvested in step 1.6 above and connect. 
                                        You should see a Windows machine user login process start up from with a MRD window. 
                                </li>
                           </ol>
                           <h3>3. Configure Your Windows Machine</h3>
                           You're now up and running with a Windows machine! 
                           You may know what to do from here, 
                           but there are a couple configuration steps that I needed. 
                           </p><br>
                           <ol>
                                   <li>
                                   You may be prompted whether you want to open the machine for local networking. 
                                   You probably don't want this. Just select No. 
                                   You can change it later, if you want. 
                                   </li>
                                   <li>You probably want to download some programs and stuff, 
                                           but the default settings disallow this. 
                                           Go to Start > Server Manager > Local Server > Enhanced Security Configuration, 
                                           then select Off for both Administrators and Users. 
                                           Now you can download programs from the internet to your machine.
                                   </li>
                                   <li>Internet Explorer comes default on these images, 
                                           and for me, almost nothing rendered properly through IE. 
                                           I suggest downloading a different browser of your choice.
                                   </li>
                                   <li>Download whatever programs and utilities you need!
                                           I downloaded git, R, and RStudio, 
                                           along with all the R packages I needed for this project. 
                                   </li>
                           </ol>
                           <p>
                           And that's it! 
                           If you get this basic workflow down, you can probably sort out how to spin up Linux or Mac machines, too, 
                           but a comprehensive intro to using EC2 is well beyond the scope of this post. 
                           Just a few more notes and caveats:
                           </p>
                           <ol>
                                   <li>
                                   I am not a cybersecurity expert. 
                                   If you are doing sensitive work, or worry about hackers or other malfeasants, 
                                   do a little more digging to sort out how best to improve security. 
                                   Check out 
                                   <a href"https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/" target="_blank">AWS GovCloud</a>. 
                                   </li>
                                   <li>You can leave this machine up on AWS as long as you like, 
                                           but you are charged for processing time if the instance is "Running", 
                                           and you're not within the free-tier limits. 
                                           If you "Stop" the instance, you will only get charged for storage, 
                                           which is very cheap. 
                                           You can have a machine at the ready, in the cloud, for only a few bucks a month, 
                                           just make sure it's Stopped, or you'll be charged for processing, which is more expensive. 
                                   </li>
                                   <li>
                                           When you restart, all your machine configurations, programs, and data will be there. 
                                           But the public IP address will have changed, 
                                           so you'll need to download a new RDP file. 
                                   </li>

                                           If you're sure you don't want the machine anymore, you can Terminate it, 
                                           but you'll lose everything. 
                                           Make sure to save any data you need before terminating.
